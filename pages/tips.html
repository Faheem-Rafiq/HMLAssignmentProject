    <div class="tip-container">

        <h3>1. Keep Your Items Clean</h3>
        <p>Regular cleaning can prevent dust and grime from building up on your items. This can help to prevent damage and prolong their lifespan.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>2. Store Your Items Properly</h3>
        <p>Proper storage can prevent your items from getting damaged or scratched. Use protective covers or cases when storing your items.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>3. Handle Your Items with Care</h3>
        <p>Be gentle when handling your items, especially if they are fragile or valuable. Use two hands when lifting heavy items.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>4. Use the right tools</h3>
        <p>Make sure you have the right tools for the job, and don't try to force something if it's not working. This can cause damage that's even more expensive to fix.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>5. Use the right tools</h3>
        <p>Make sure you have the right tools for the job, and don't try to force something if it's not working. This can cause damage that's even more expensive to fix.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>6. Keep it clean</h3>
        <p>Clean your items regularly to prevent buildup of dust and debris, which can cause damage over time. Use a soft, damp cloth and avoid harsh chemicals.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>7. Don't DIY everything</h3>
        <p>While it's great to be able to fix things yourself, sometimes it's best to leave the repairs to the professionals. Trying to fix something beyond your skill level can lead to further damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>8. Keep an inventory</h3>
        <p>Maintain a record of all the items you have and their repair history. This will help you keep track of what needs to be repaired and when, and can be useful for insurance purposes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>9. Know when to replace</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it's better to replace an item than to try to repair it. This is especially true for items that are outdated or beyond repair. Consider the cost of repairs versus the cost of replacement.</p>
